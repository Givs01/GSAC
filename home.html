		<br>
		<p> In recent years, there is an emerging recognition of linkages between climate change and WASH. 
		A better understanding of these links is critical for making WASH services climate resilient. </p>
		
				<p>Many countries in the Global South have achieved significant progress towards sustainable water and sanitation services, 
				while mitigating and adapting to climate change. Climate response will also require a renewed focus on improved access to services at home. 
				With varied approaches being used across countries, knowledge in the Global South can be an effective catalyst for accelerating development 
				towards SDGs and climate resilience. Peer-to-peer learning will help provide practical insights about approaches that work, and pitfalls to avoid.
				<br>
				In this context, a South-to-South Conclave amongst academic institutions is being organised to focus on cross learning across countries and regions.
				<br> The Conclave will be held between 2nd to 4th February, 2024 in Ahmedabad, India.</p>
